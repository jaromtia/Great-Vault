#cybersecurity-concepts 

Both the sender and receiver use a symmetric key, which is a second instance of the same key, to encrypt and decrypt messages. The confidentiality of the keys is a pivotal aspect of symmetric encryption. Providing a secure method for key distribution presents a notable challenge in symmetric encryption, commonly known as the "key distribution problem." If these keys end up with malicious individuals, they could potentially decrypt the messages.

# Benefits
Speed

# Cons
Challenges of key distribution and key management
Number of user increase then number of keys increase 
- Key management problem
# Use cases
