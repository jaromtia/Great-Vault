# **Company B Vulnerability Report**

Company B performed this vulnerability assessment in anticipation of system integration with Company A. This assessment was performed by a qualified third-party assessor, and this report has been generated with the results. This assessment was performed in accordance with a methodology described in NIST 800-30 Rev 1 to identify the following:

~~·~~         Vulnerabilities using the CVSS model
·         Severity
~~·~~         Likelihood of occurrence

## Table A. Risk Classifications

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Risk Level**|**Description**|
|High|The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability may be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.|
|Moderate|The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability may be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.|
|Low|The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability may be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.|

## Table B. Severity

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Severity Level (CVSS Model)**|**Description**|
|Critical|- Exploitation of the vulnerability likely results in root-level compromise of servers or infrastructure devices.<br>- Exploitation is usually straightforward in the sense that the attacker does not need any special authentication credentials or knowledge about individual victims and does not need to persuade a target user, for example, via social engineering, to perform any special functions.|
|High|- The vulnerability is difficult to exploit.<br>- Exploitation could result in elevated privileges.<br>- Exploitation could result in significant data loss or downtime.|
|Medium|- Vulnerabilities that require the attacker to manipulate individual victims via social engineering tactics.<br>- Denial of service vulnerabilities that are difficult to set up.<br>- Exploits that require an attacker to reside on the same local network as the victim.<br>- Vulnerabilities where exploitation provides only very limited access.<br>- Vulnerabilities that require user privileges for successful exploitation.|
|Low|Exploitation of such vulnerabilities usually requires local or physical system access and would have little impact on the organization.|

## Table C. Level of Effort

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Level of Effort**|**Description**|
|High|This requires a high level of dedicated effort from one or more teams on critical systems, including patching, multiple configuration changes, or highly technical changes that risk bringing services down.|
|Moderate|This is a medium-level effort that requires substantial dedication from a partial or entire team. This could impact services or cause a partial outage.|
|Low|These are individual or small team efforts generally requiring a minimal time commitment and require running an update or remedial command or series of commands that will not impact production services.|

## Table D. System Inventory
