# SOC and its role

Monitoring

- Using tools to automate and look through aggregated logs for threats
- Continuous observation for unusual activity

Detect

- Based off of detection logic and the logs generated from end-points or networks, alert and report malicious activity
- Utilize threat detection techniques
- Identify based off of IOCs

Analyze

- Determine whether or not activity is a true positive
- Who, What, When, Where, Why of the threat and potential threat actors
- Trace tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)

Respond

- Action based of analysis and mitigate any impact or vulnerabilities made by the threat actors
- Contain threats, mitigate impact, and restore normal operations
- Formulate playbooks for these events through lessons learned

## Key Functions of a SOC

Reactive

- Monitoring and Detection
    - Network and system logs, alerts
    - SIEM, IDS, IPS etc.
- Incident Response
    - Alert Triage
    - Collect evidence and artifacts
    - Investigate, contain, and mitigate threats
- Forensic Analysis
    - Preserve evidence and engage legal
- Malware Analysis
    - Sandbox and reverse engineer malware

Proactive

- Threat Intelligence
    - gather IOCs and behaviors from threat actors
    - study threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks
- Threat Hunting
    - Search for malicious activity or intrusions
    - Logs, network traffic, endpoint telemetry
- Vulnerability Management
    - Patch vulnerabilities and keep up to date
    - Scan environments for weaknesses
- Security Awareness Training
    - Security professionals train non-technical people to become use security practices

# Information Security Refresher

[[CIA Triad]]

- [[Confidentiality]]
    - Protecting data from those un-authorized
    - Enforces authorizations
- [[Integrity]]
    - Protecting data at rest or in transit from being modified without authorization
- [[Availability]]
    - Keeping resources and services in use when user’s expect them to be in use or needed

[[AAA Framework]]
- [[Authentication]]
    - Proving a person is who they say they are?
- [[Authorization]]
    - What user’s have access to based off their authentication
- [[Accounting]]
    - Keeping logs

[[Vulnerability]]
- What allows a threat in
- A weakness within a network, system, or process that can be exploited

[[Threat]]
- Potential danger to information or systems

[[Risk]]
- Impact * Threat = Risk
- The potential impact that a threat could have on a process, system, or network
- Likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability

Log

- A recordable and observable record that show information on events, actions, processes, and infrastructure

Security Event

- An observable occurrence that show potential to being a threat to information systems

Security Incident

- An occurrence that is a known threat to systems and processes

Alert

- A notification that has been generated by systems or processes

## Security Controls

Defense in depth

- Layering security processes to cover as many gaps as possible

Administrative Controls

- Policies, plans, and procedures

Technical Controls

- Software or systems such as firewalls, EDR, etc

Physical Controls

- Actual physical devices or services

## Security Control Functions

Preventative

- Reduces likelihood of others getting an attack succeding

Detective

- Do not prevent but monitors and detects activity

Corrective

- Triages and mitigates once the damage has been done

Deterrent

- Eliminate or reduce impact of an intrusion
- Warning signs to say “not allowed in here”

Compensating

- when a primary control is no longer available
- supplements primary controls and helps provide a stronger services but is not the primary service itself

## Risk Control Strategies

Risk Transference

- Shifting responsibility of risk to a third-party

Risk Acceptance

- Tolerate a certain level of risk
- Often accepted when the impact of the risk is not worth the time and cost of fixing the risk

Risk Avoidance

- Remove possibility of risk

Risk Mitigation

- Proactive measures to reduce risk

## Security Policies

Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

- What is and isn’t allowed within an organization

Password Policy

- How should passwords be rotated and created

Data Classification Policy

- How is data handled both in rest and in transit?

Change Management Policy

- git

Disaster Recovery Policy

- Recovery IT systems and data when unseen events or disasters occur

# SOC Models

Internal SOC

- Owned and operated by organization

Managed SOC

- Third-party provider of security operations

Hybrid SOC

- Mix of in-house resources and managed SOC services

## SOC Roles

SOC Analysts

Specialized Roles

Managed Roles

# Incident and Event Management

Event Management

- Collection, normalization analysis
- Collecting logs, alerting, and managing endpoints
- Identify abnormal or suspicious actives
- Security Information Event Manager

Incident Management

- Incident identification
- Incident classification
- incident investigation
- incident containment
- Incident Eradication
- Incident Recovery

Detection Outcomes

- False Positive
    - Alerted on event that was not malicious
- False Negative
    - Did not alert on event that was malicious and should have been alerted on
- True Positive
    - Correctly alerted on a malicious event
- True Negative
    - Correctly did not alert on a non-malicious event

# SOC Metrics

Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)

Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)

Meant Time to Attend an Analyze (MMTA&A)

Incident Detection Rate

False Positive Rates (FPR)

False Negative Rates (FNR)

# Common Threats and Attacks

Social Engineering

- [[Phishing]]
- [[Vishing]]
- [[Spear Phishing]]
- [[Spoofing]]
- [[Smishing]]
- [[QRPhishing]]

Malware
- Worm, virus, spyware, trojan, adware, ransomware, fileless malware

Identify and Account Compromise

- credential theft
