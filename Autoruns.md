# Command Line

New-Autoruns Baseline - Baseline
```powershell
Get-PSAutorun -VerifyDigitalSignature |
Where { -not($_.isOSbinary)} |
New-AutoRunsBaseLine -Verbose -FilePath .\Baseline.ps1
```


New-Autoruns Baseline - Current State
```powershell
Get-PSAutorun -VerifyDigitalSignature |
Where { -not($_.isOSbinary)} |
New-AutoRunsBaseLine -Verbose -FilePath .\CurrentState.ps1
```

# How to use

Run Autorun twice. One for the baseline of a machine that you believe to be fairly safe. The other of the current state of the machine

After that you can run
```powershell
Compare-AutoRunsBaseLine -ReferenceBaseLineFile .\Baseline.ps1 -DifferentBaseLineFile .\CurrentState.ps1
```

This will show the differences between baselines for you.
