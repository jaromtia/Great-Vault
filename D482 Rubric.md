A.      List two network security problems and two current infrastructure problems for Company A and Company B. You will need 8 problems total, clearly label each. For more information about Business Requirements see section 1 of the course material.

B.      Use the network diagrams, Company A’s Risk Analysis and Company B’s Vulnerability Report and Tools to list identify two vulnerabilities. Explain why each is a vulnerability and list the impact, risk, and likelihood.

C.      Company A and B will remain at separate locations. This rubric section can be accomplished in many ways, the wrong way is to move all of Company B’s hardware to company A’s site. You are not expected to replace all end-of-life hardware or OS, target the critical items. Remember- company executives have provided a budget of $50,000 in the first year to create a secure network design to utilize cloud-based services. You must incorporate cloud services to pass this aspect of the task. There is also a push for Zero Trust, you may want to show how you will implement Zero Trust in your topology. You can further explain this in the security principles section!

D.      Provide both the OSI and TCP/IP layers for each device on your topology- servers, workstations, firewalls, routers, etc. All devices on your topology must be discussed in this section down to the cabling. I would suggest using the chart below. List the highest layer the device operates at.

|                          |           |              |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| Device                   | OSI Layer | TCP/IP Layer |
| Firewall                 |           |              |
| Router                   |           |              |
| Servers                  |           |              |
| Cabling                  |           |              |
| VPN                      |           |              |
| Laptops and Workstations |           |              |
| WAP                      |           |              |
| Printers                 |           |              |
| Cloud Solution           |           |              |

E.       Discuss the components you purchased, retained or repurposed. Explain why you purchased, retained or repurposed the device. Provide the price for the device if you purchased it and explain why it made sense to purchase. If you retained or repurposed the device, explain why it made financial sense. Use the internet to research price information, cite your sources!

F.       For the design principles discuss at least two network design principles that you implemented into your topology and give specific examples of how you implemented them. This could be a great place to address Zero Trust!

G.      Discuss two relevant regulatory compliances. Remember NIST and ISO are standards, not regulations. Discuss why the regulations you choose are relevant to the merged companies and how you implemented them into your topology. Give examples!

H.      Discuss threats that would occur during or after the merger. Remember a vulnerability is a weakness, a threat takes advantage of a vulnerability. You must discuss threats that could occur during or because of the merger.

I.         For help with creating a Cost Benefit Analysis see section 3 of the course material. Cloud services are discussed in detail in section 2 of the course material. 

J.        Ensure you have properly cited your sources and include a ‘works cited’ page.  The Writing Center can help with this if needed.
