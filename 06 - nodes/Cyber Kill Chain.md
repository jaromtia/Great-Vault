## Weaponization 
Finding exploit or chaining exploits and payloads needed for target

## Delivery
How to get exploits and payloads to target 
- Phishing 
- USB drives in parking lot 
- Supply chain attacks
	- using legitimate software to attack targets 
## Exploitation
When payload is executed on target environment 
Marks the point when an attacker gains access into a system
## Installation
Installing additional malware to keep persistence 
Ensure that attacker can return to system 
## Command and Control (C2)
Create communication channel between attacker and controller to remotely access system without having to re-exploit the system 
Typically uses benign protocols to hide persistence 
## Actions on Objectives 
Acting on the actual objectives for attacking the target 
- defacing 
- exfiltration  
- hacktivism 
- strategic advantages
