Data at rest refers to information stored in filesystems on mass-storage devices (SSD, M.2, HDD, etc.), databases, and cloud storage. Encryption in the scenarios requires transforming the data using protocols such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). For example, if an attacker gains access to the physical storage devices used in a healthcare provider's database, the data stored on them would be unreadable.
