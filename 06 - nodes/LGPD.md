The LGPD, which went into effect on September 18, 2020, is Brazil's comprehensive data protection regulation. It is based on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and aims to standardize data protection laws across Brazil, improving privacy rights for individuals. The LGPD applies to any organization processing personal data of Brazillian constituents, regardless of where the organization is located. It provides individuals with rights such as access to information, data correction, deletion, and the right to be informed about data sharing. The law also stresses the importance of obtaining explicit consent from data subjects and requires strict data security measures, with significant fines for violations.
