Guidelines are unique because they are advisory in nature instead of mandatory. They offer recommended practices but allow for flexibility and discretion in implementation. Guidelines support the practical application of policies, procedures, and standards by providing context that helps organizations navigate complex or unforeseen situations where strict adherence to procedures or standards might not be possible or feasible.
