Assessments, by contrast, are generally more flexible. They aim to evaluate certain aspects of organizational performance. For example, a cybersecurity assessment might identify vulnerabilities in an IT system as a matter of risk management practices instead of a more formal audit. Assessments are often diagnostic in nature and used to identify opportunities for improvement, manage risk, or inform strategic decisions. They may not have the formal scrutiny of audits, but they are still crucial for maintaining operational oversight.
