The CCPA, which was enacted in 2018 and became effective on January 1, 2020, is a significant privacy law in the United States. It provides California residents with extensive rights over their personal data. These rights include the ability to know what personal information is being collected, the purpose of collection, and with whom it is being shared. Consumers can request access to their data, demand its deletion, and opt out of the sale of their information. The CCPA imposes strict requirements on businesses, mandating transparency and accountability in data practices, with significant penalties for non-compliance.
