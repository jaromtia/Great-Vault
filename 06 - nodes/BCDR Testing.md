Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) testing ensures that an organization can effectively respond to major disruptions and maintain (or quickly resume) critical operations.

As previously identified, one key strategy is backup verification testing, which involves periodically restoring data from backups to verify their integrity and performance.

Full-scale and parallel disaster recovery drills test the effectiveness of the BCDR plan. These drills involve activating the recovery plan, activating backup systems, and operating from alternate sites to assess the organization's preparedness. Parallel tests differ from full-scale tests by allowing the DR site to be tested without impacting normal operations.

Tabletop exercises allow stakeholders to review and discuss the BCDR plan and their roles during a disaster. This is a surprisingly effective way to help identify gaps in the plan and ensure everyone understands their responsibilities.
