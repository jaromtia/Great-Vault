Generally, standards specify the minimum acceptable levels of compliance for many activities. Standards differ from procedures in that they help define the parameters within which policies and procedures operate. Standards help ensure that an organization meets various expectations for compliance, security, and performance. For example, a standard often defines "what great looks like," and this definition helps steer the level of detail and substance contained within policies, and the type and quantity of procedures incorporated by the organization to steer employee actions. A practical example includes using the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) to influence a corporate data protection policy's content directly. PCI-DSS provides very specific, mandatory security requirements for protecting the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) and practices regarding vulnerability assessment and remediation. These details identify specific best practices that are then adapted to form the organization's policies and procedures.
