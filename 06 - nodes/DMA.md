The Digital Markets Act (DMA) primarily addresses the regulatory environment for digital markets within the European Union, aiming to ensure fair competition and prevent anti-competitive practices by large digital platforms. While its main focus is on market dynamics and consumer protection, it also encompasses facets of cybersecurity by mandating that digital platforms adhere to stringent security measures. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) has significant implications for cybersecurity operations, particularly for large digital platforms known as "gatekeepers." These gatekeepers, typically major online platforms (the "big five:"Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft) with substantial influence over digital markets, are subject to strict regulatory requirements under the DMA to ensure fair competition and enhanced security practices.
