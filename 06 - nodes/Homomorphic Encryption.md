advanced form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on ciphertexts, producing an encrypted result that, when decrypted, matches the outcome of operations as if they were actually performed on the plaintext. This technique enables secure data processing and computation without exposing the underlying data and maintains data privacy while allowing meaningful operations to be performed on sensitive data. The result is extremely compelling because it allows encrypted sensitive data to be shared with a third party, who can then process it without revealing any sensitive information! Applications range broadly from secure data storage and cloud computing to medical research and financial services.

Homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation [[SMC]] share the goal of preserving data privacy during computation. While homomorphic encryption focuses on enabling computations on encrypted data without decryption, SMC allows for collaborative computation among multiple parties without sharing their individual inputs. Both approaches offer solutions to privacy-preserving data analysis.
