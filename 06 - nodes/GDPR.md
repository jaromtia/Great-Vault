The General Data Protection Regulation enforces rules for organizations that offer services to entities in the European Union (EU) or that collect and analyze data on a subject located there. The GDPR rules are stringent and apply regardless of where the originating organization operates from or where the collected data is stored. Failure to comply with GDPR rules results in extremely costly fines.

There are seven principles of the GDPR:

1. Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency—Personal data must be processed legally, fairly, and transparently, ensuring individuals are aware of how their data is used.
2. Purpose limitation—Data must be collected for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.
3. Data minimization—Only the data that is necessary for the intended purpose should be collected and processed.
4. Accuracy—Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date, with inaccurate data corrected or deleted without delay.
5. Storage limitation—Data should be kept in a form that permits the identification of individuals only as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
6. Integrity and confidentiality (security)—Personal data must be processed securely, protecting it from unauthorized or unlawful processing, loss, destruction, or damage.
7. Accountability—Organizations must take responsibility for complying with GDPR principles and be able to demonstrate their compliance.
