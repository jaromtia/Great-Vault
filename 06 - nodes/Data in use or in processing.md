Data in use/processing presents unique challenges because this data state applies to data actively used by applications. Because data must be decrypted before it can be processed, it exposes it to threats and unauthorized access and also hints at the value of memory-based attacks. [[Homomorphic encryption]] specifically addresses this concern by allowing computations directly on encrypted data, with no decryption needed. Homomorphic encryption holds promise for scenarios where data protection and privacy are paramount, such as in cloud computing, financial transactions, and medical research. For example, a medical research organization could provide health data to a third party to perform DNA analysis without ever revealing sensitive patient information.
