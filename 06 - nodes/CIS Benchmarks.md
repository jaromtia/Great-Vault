CIS Benchmark configuration guides can be downloaded for free and include detailed descriptions of all configuration points, although the documents are very lengthy to use in this way [https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/). CIS offers a software tool for checking configurations called CIS CAT, but access to the tool is limited to CIS Members. CIS benchmarks are also available in the Wazuh Security Platform, the professional version of the Tenable Nessus vulnerability scanner, and CIS-hardened images are available for deployment within major cloud platforms, such as AWS or Azure.
