Post-Quantum Cryptography

Quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm can efficiently solve the discrete logarithm and integer factorization problems, which underpin the security of Diffie-Hellman and ECC. The ramifications are that once quantum computers become sufficiently advanced, they could crack these cryptographic schemes almost instantaneously.
