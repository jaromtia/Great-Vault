describes how a cryptographic key can be split into multiple parts and distributed among different parties to ensure that no single entity has complete control over a key. This approach is useful in scenarios where trust is distributed among multiple stakeholders, such as with blockchain technologies. Key splitting improves security by ensuring that the entire key remains secure even if part of the key is compromised.
