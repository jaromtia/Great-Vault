 sophisticated method of managing encryption keys. Data is first encrypted with a data encryption key (DEK), and then the DEK is encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK). The KEK is often stored in a hardware security module (HSM) or a dedicated key management service (KMS). By separating data encryption from key management, envelope encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted or otherwise accessed without authorization, it remains incomprehensible without the corresponding DEK. Only the KEK needs to be changed when it is time to rotate keys. The DEK is then re-encrypted with the new KEK, meaning the underlying encrypted data does not need to be decrypted and re-encrypted with a new key. The process of key-rotation is, therefore, much faster and less resource-intensive.
