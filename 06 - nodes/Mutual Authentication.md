Mutual authentication is a process that builds trust between two parties by allowing them to verify each other's identities. In contrast to the more common one-way authentication method, where only the server is authenticated, mutual authentication requires both the server and the client to prove their identities. The mutual authentication process is typically dependent on the exchange of digital certificates, which play a pivotal role in verifying the identities of the parties. This process is used in environments requiring a high degree of trust and is foundational to Zero-Trust architectural design principles. Mutual authentication is sometimes referred to as two-way authenticaton and can be used to validate client and server endpoints in APIs or simple websites, device connectivity to physical or WiFi networks, VPN connections, and any other scenario where trust must be established in both directions.
