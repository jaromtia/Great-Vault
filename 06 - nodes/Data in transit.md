Data in this state can include a wide variety of types, like emails, web traffic, authentication requests, and any other data exchanged between devices. Encryption at this level ensures that data remains unreadable even if intercepted. [[TLS]] (Transport Layer Security) is ubiquitous for protecting data in transit (transport encryption) because it is very versatile. An important consideration for securing data in transit is validating the authenticity of endpoints, which is typically achieved using digital certificates.
