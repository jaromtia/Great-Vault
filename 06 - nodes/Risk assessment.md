**Risk management** is a complex and multifaceted discipline, with approaches varying significantly from one organization to another. Factors such as size, sector, and regulatory and compliance requirements all influence how risk is handled. Many companies adopt enterprise risk management (ERM) policies and procedures, often based on established frameworks such as NIST's Risk Management Framework (RMF) or ISO 31000.
