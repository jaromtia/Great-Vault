a quantitative risk assessment uses numerical data and calculations to provide a more objective measure of risk probability and potential consequences, often assigning monetary values to the impact

[[Quantitative Measures]]

The variables used in quantitative analysis include the following:

**Single Loss Expectancy ([[SLE]])**—The amount lost in a single occurrence of the risk factor. Another way to think of single loss expectancy is "the cost of a single event," such as downtime.

****Annual Rate of Occurrence (**[[ARO]])**—The number of times a single loss occurs in a year. For example, if a server outage is identified as an SLE event, and the outage occurs twice a month, then the ARO would be two times per month, multiplied by 12 months in a year to result in an ARO of 24.

****Annualized Loss Expectancy (**[[ALE]]**)—The amount that would be lost over the course of a year, or the sum-total of all single loss events over the span of 12 months.

ALE = SLE x ARO

Single Loss Expectancy can be further broken down into the following components:

**Asset Value (AV)**—The value of an asset, such as a server or even an entire building.

**Exposure Factor (EF)**—EF is the percentage of the asset value that would be lost. For example, if a building is exposed to a severe weather event, like a hurricane, tornado, or earthquake, only part of the building may be lost and this would be described as its "exposure factor."

SLE = AV x EF

When component costs can be easily determined, quantitative assessment can quickly identify appropriate courses of action.

The challenge of quantitative risk analysis becomes apparent when component costs are not clear. Sometimes, the value of component costs can be difficult to determine without historical data and this results in subjective guesswork. Despite this potential challenge, quantitative risk assessment frequently yields an effective description of assets and risks resulting in a sound basis for decision-making.
