## Legal Jurisdiction

Understanding legal jurisdiction is essential when considering legal risk. The following list identifies the various jurisdictions that shape legal compliance.

- Federal laws govern the entire United States, applying to all states and citizens within the country.
- Federal regulations are special laws issued by federal agencies to enforce compliance across industry sectors, such as finance, healthcare, energy, transportation, communications, and environmental protection.
- State laws are statutes and regulations enacted by individual U.S. states and govern that specific state.
- International law encompasses rules and principles that govern the relationships and practices between nations.

This is complicated by organizations with international operations and for organizations operating public cloud platforms where the controlling corporation, cloud operations, and customers are dispersed globally.

## Legal Risk and Compliance

E-discovery, or electronic discovery, refers to identifying, collecting, preserving, reviewing, and producing electronically stored information (ESI) in response to legal or regulatory requests. E-discovery ensures that all relevant digital evidence can be efficiently accessed and provided during litigation, investigations, and audits.

A legal hold is an order to preserve all relevant information before anticipated litigation. Understanding legal hold requirements ensures that data potentially relevant to ongoing or future legal cases is not destroyed or altered. It is critically important to establish processes for promptly identifying when a legal hold is necessary and ensuring that all pertinent data is preserved. As the legal situation that prompted the hold evolves, it is essential to correlate it to previous assumptions regarding what must be preserved.

Due diligence describes a thorough assessment of an organization's security posture, risks, and compliance status and is especially important during mergers, acquisitions, or partnerships. The due diligence process generally includes evaluating cybersecurity controls, identifying potential risks, and reviewing all applicable legal and regulatory requirements to assess compliance levels. Due diligence helps to mitigate risks and avoid exposure to legal liabilities.

Due care refers to the level of judgment, care, prudence, determination, and activity a "reasonable person" would be expected to perform under different circumstances. In a cybersecurity program, due care describes the initial implementation of security controls intended to protect data and systems. Adequate due care generally aligns with following established best practices and standards for mitigating risks and protecting against threats. Due care is the starting point, whereas due diligence describes the ongoing efforts required to maintain sufficient protection.

Export controls govern the transfer of certain types of information, technology, software, and hardware to foreign countries or entities. Managing export controls means ensuring that products subject to these regulations are not unlawfully shared or exported, and appropriate controls are required to ensure compliance with all applicable restrictions.

Recent examples of U.S. export controls:

Contractual obligations in cybersecurity refer to the specific requirements and responsibilities that an organization agrees to in contracts with third parties, customers, or service providers. These obligations often include provisions related to data protection, security standards, incident response, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that credit card information is used in a secure environment. Enforcement of PCI-DSS is not carried out by a government agency but rather by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) and the major credit card brands via various legal contracts and other agreements.
