Cyber risk validation and remediation practices ensure that identified risks are accurately assessed and effectively mitigated to protect an organization's critical assets and data. Validation begins after initial risk assessment and prioritization is complete. Validation aims to confirm that the identified risks are real and significant. Validation activities often include penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and threat modeling.

Once risks are validated, remediation efforts can begin. Remediation aims to reduce identified risks to acceptable levels, the definition of which varies from one organization to another. This process starts with developing a remediation plan that outlines the actions needed to address each risk. These actions generally include applying patches to fix software vulnerabilities, updating security configurations, implementing additional security controls, improving security policies and procedures, and employee training.
