The DoD SCAP (Secure Communications Architecture Program) Compliance Checker is available for download for free and can run automated system configuration checks against STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guides) Benchmarks [https://www.cyber.mil/stigs/](https://www.cyber.mil/stigs/). DoD STIGs also include GPO (Microsoft Active Directory Group Policy Objects) objects that contain many best practice security configurations, although GPOs must be carefully inspected and tested prior to use/deployment to avoid unintended consequences such as breaking a system or software functionality.
