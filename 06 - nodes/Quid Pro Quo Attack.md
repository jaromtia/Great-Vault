#cybersecurity-concepts 

Deceptive tactic used by attackers where they offer a seemingly helpful service or information in exchange for sensitive personal data or access to a victim's system

Basically: "Give me something valuable, and I'll give you something in return"

Quid Pro Quo = "something for something"
