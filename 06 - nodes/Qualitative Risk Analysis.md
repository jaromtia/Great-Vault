[[Qualitative measures]]

Qualitative risk analysis describes the evaluation of risk through the use of words. For this reason, qualitative risk analysis is much more subjective than quantitative analysis. Qualitative risk analysis is well-suited to the analysis of intangible assets, for example an organization's reputation or brand image. These things are far more complicated to assess numerically and so quantitative analysis is often avoided. Qualitative risk analysis requires significant contributions from the marketing, sales, and communications departments (just to name a few) as these groups are best-suited, based on their unique insights, to assess the value of many intangible business assets and the impacts that various risk events can have on them.
