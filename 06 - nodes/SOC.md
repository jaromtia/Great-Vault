**System and Organization Controls (SOC)** uses standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to evaluate the policies, processes, and procedures in place and designed to protect technology and financial operations. In particular, SOC 2 is a framework for managing customer data based on five trust service principles: **security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.** It ensures that organizations have effective controls to protect data from unauthorized access and cyber threats, which is crucial in today's landscape of frequent data breaches.

Achieving SOC 2 compliance demonstrates a commitment to data security and helps meet various regulatory requirements, such as those mandated by GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). This level of compliance demonstrates robust security practices to potential clients and customers. Additionally, becoming SOC 2 compliant often leads to internal operational improvements in risk management and IT infrastructure. For organizations using third-party vendors, SOC 2 reports offer a standardized way to assess the security of these vendors, providing insight and assurance regarding data protection practices in the supply chain.
