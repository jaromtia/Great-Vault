Audits are typically rigorous and formal processes conducted by external groups and sometimes internal audit teams to verify that an organization complies with its policies and legal mandates. An audit uses a formal approach that seeks to measure performance against a specific metric. The scope and scrutiny of an audit are broad and can be used to assess compliance with internal policy or an industry standard. Audits can take days, weeks, months, or longer and be performed by a single person or a large team. Ultimately, the audit will produce a report identifying strengths and weaknesses and a report that identifies a prioritized list of recommended actions.
