The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a highly regarded and widely adopted framework in the United States, plays a crucial role in helping organizations define six core functions within a cybersecurity program. Moreover, it offers a structured approach for continuous improvement, guided by the development of an organizational profile and an assessment of risk management practices against established CSF Tiers.

The six core functions are:

1. Govern—Establish and enforce organizational policies and procedures to ensure cybersecurity risk management.
2. Identify—Develop an understanding of organizational cybersecurity risks to manage and minimize them effectively.
3. Protect—Implement safeguards to ensure critical infrastructure services and sensitive data are secured.
4. Detect—Implement activities to identify the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents promptly.
5. Respond—Develop and implement strategies to contain the impact of detected cybersecurity incidents.
6. Recover—Implement plans to restore capabilities and services affected by cybersecurity incidents.

Organizational profiles are utilized to interpret the core outcomes by taking into account an organization's mission objectives, stakeholder expectations, threat landscape, and requirements. This allows an organization to prioritize its actions in order to achieve specific outcomes and communicate this information to stakeholders.

1. Scope the Organizational Profile.
2. Gather the information needed to prepare the Organizational Profile.
3. Create the Organizational Profile.
4. Analyze the gaps between the Current and Target Profiles and create an action plan.
5. Implement the action plan and update the Organizational Profile.

CSF Tiers represent the level of an organization's cybersecurity risk governance and management practices, offering insight into the organization's approach to cybersecurity risks and its risk management processes.
