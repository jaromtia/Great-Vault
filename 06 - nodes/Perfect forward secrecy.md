Forward secrecy, also known as perfect forward secrecy (PFS), ensures that past communications remain secure even if a long-term key is compromised. Forward secrecy is achieved by generating temporary session keys used for a single session and then discarding them once the session has been completed. This way, if an attacker obtains a session key, they can only access the data for that session, leaving previous and future communications protected. Forward secrecy depends upon key exchange protocols like Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, which support the secure generation and exchange of session (ephemeral) keys. This attribute is essential in protocols like HTTPS, where maintaining confidentiality is crucial.
