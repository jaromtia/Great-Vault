**Risk appetite** is often prescribed via regulations and defines how an organization will address identified risks. Some organizations will assertively address all items ranked via risk assessment as "medium" and "high." Other organizations may focus their attention only on items ranked as "high," and others may take a completely different approach, but all of these different approaches are based on appetite.
