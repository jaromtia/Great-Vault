Cyber risk prioritization involves assessing and ranking the various threats an organization faces regarding their potential impact and likelihood. Organizations typically start by identifying critical assets and understanding their value and importance to business operations. Threats can come from various sources, such as cybercriminals, insiders, or even nation-states, while vulnerabilities might be found in outdated software, weak security protocols, or human error. Understanding the specific threats and vulnerabilities relevant to the organization is essential for accurate risk assessment.

Risk assessment frameworks from ISO, NIST, and others provide structured risk evaluation approaches. These frameworks typically recommend evaluating each threat's impact and likelihood of exploiting a vulnerability. Based on these evaluations, organizations can then prioritize risks. High-impact, high-likelihood risks should be addressed first, as they pose the most significant threat to the organization. Risk prioritization helps ensure that resources are used effectively to improve security where needed.
