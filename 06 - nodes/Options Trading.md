# General strategy 

## Spreads 

### PUT Spread ([[Bearish Market]])
Stock go down = make money --> PUT 

Buy PUT for more than strike price 
Sell PUT for less value than bought one 

Downside: Filling the contract 
- If no one is buying then its hard to get into this strategy 

On Webull use vertical options for spread trading

#### Example

### CALL Spreads ([[Bullish Market]])
Buy CALL for more than strike price 
Sell CALL for less value than bought one 

# Understanding options 

Give more than two weeks minimum buying a stocks. Buying in days you either win or lose. Buying at a minimum of two weeks gives you leverage to make money overtime

**Never** do less than a month for buying a call. The time-decay for 4 days out is bad.

Buy multiple spreads within the same company


# Terms
Time-decay - option contracts gradually lose value until its expiration
