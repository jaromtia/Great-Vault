The ISO/IEC 27000 series provides a comprehensive framework for managing information security, focusing on establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS). Its objective is to help organizations protect their information assets by adopting a risk management approach to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The ISO/IEC 27000 series evaluates an organization's practices through a systematic approach. First, the organization implements an Information Security Management System (ISMS) based on the requirements and guidelines specified in ISO/IEC 27001, which outlines the required policies, procedures, and controls to manage information security risks effectively.

Evaluation begins with a risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to the organization's information assets. Based on the assessment results, the organization develops a risk treatment plan to mitigate identified risks through appropriate security controls. Controls are selected from the set provided in ISO/IEC 27002, representing best practice recommendations for information security management.

Once the ISMS is in place, internal audits verify that the implemented controls are functioning as intended and are aligned with the organization's security policies. Additionally, accredited certification bodies perform audits to assess compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 standards. ISO/IEC 27001 certification is achieved when an organization successfully demonstrates that its ISMS meets the standard's requirements.
