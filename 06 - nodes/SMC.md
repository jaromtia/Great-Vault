Secure multiparty computation (SMC) is a cryptographic method that allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. For example, each party inputs private data, and through a series of encrypted exchanges, they can collaboratively compute the desired result without revealing their private information to others. Applications of SMC include secret sharing, which describes a method of dividing data into parts and distributing it among various participants, and oblivious transfer, which is a cryptographic protocol where a sender has multiple pieces of information and a receiver chooses one of them to learn, without the sender knowing which piece was chosen.

[[Homomorphic encryption]] and secure multiparty computation [[SMC]] share the goal of preserving data privacy during computation. While homomorphic encryption focuses on enabling computations on encrypted data without decryption, SMC allows for collaborative computation among multiple parties without sharing their individual inputs. Both approaches offer solutions to privacy-preserving data analysis.
