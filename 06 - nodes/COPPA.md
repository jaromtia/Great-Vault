The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a US federal law designed to protect the privacy of children (inside and outside the United States) under the age of thirteen. It requires operators of websites or online services to provide clear privacy policies and details when consent from a parent or guardian is required. The act also describes the operator's responsibilities to protect information from being used for marketing purposes.
