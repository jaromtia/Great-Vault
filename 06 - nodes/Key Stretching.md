technique designed to strengthen a weak key through repeated hashing or the use of algorithms like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt. Key stretching significantly improves the security of cryptographic keys by effectively mitigating the risk posed by dictionary and brute-force attacks. The fundamental concept is to convert a potentially weak input, such as a user-chosen password, into a much stronger cryptographic key.
