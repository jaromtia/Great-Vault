The **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** is a dedicated computer chip designed to secure hardware and is used extensively to enhance a device's security at the hardware level. One of its primary roles in many is to perform integrity checks on the bootloader, the program responsible for initializing and loading the operating system. When the device is configured, cryptographic hashes of the authorized bootloader are stored in the TPM. The hashes serve as a benchmark for verifying the integrity of the bootloader during each boot process. When the device starts up, the TPM is invoked to compare the cryptographic hash of the bootloader currently on the system to the trusted hash values stored within the TPM. This comparison is done within the TPM to prevent any external interference. If the hash of the current bootloader matches one of the trusted hashes stored in the TPM, the boot process continues, establishing a "chain of trust." If the TPM finds that the current bootloader's hash does not match the trusted hash, it indicates a potential security risk, such as tampering or corruption. In response, the TPM can initiate protective actions. These actions might include preventing the boot process from proceeding or limiting the device's capabilities until the issue is resolved. This ensures that potentially compromised software does not load and protects the integrity of the device's operating system and data.
