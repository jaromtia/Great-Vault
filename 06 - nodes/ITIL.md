ITIL is also well-suited for establishing a GRC program. ITIL focuses specifically on the "service delivery" aspects of IT management. In the context of ITIL, "Service delivery" refers to a comprehensive set of management practices designed to ensure that IT services align with business objectives. ITIL continuously checks that IT services are providing value to the organization and provides guidance regarding the management of risk and compliance best practices. ITIL emphasizes continuous improvement, making it ideal for organizations actively working to improve GRC processes in general, information and their cybersecurity operations specifically.

ITIL supports cybersecurity operations through its structured framework for managing business-aligned IT services. Its focus on service management makes it particularly useful for integrating cybersecurity into IT operations. ITIL advocates continuous service improvement, which can be adapted to cybersecurity operations. For example, structured reviews of security incidents can drive improvements in detection and response capabilities. Additionally, ITIL emphasizes secure service design and controlled service transition processes, which help prevent security issues during the deployment and operation of IT services.
