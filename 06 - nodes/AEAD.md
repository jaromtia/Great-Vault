Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) ensures that data remains private and also guarantees that data has not been altered. AEAD combines the functionalities of encryption and message authentication. In contrast to traditional encryption methods that often treat confidentiality and integrity tasks independently. AEAD algorithms do this by embedding authentication within encryption processes to ensure that any modification to encrypted data can be immediately detected. Integrity checks are achieved by using an authentication tag that accompanies the ciphertext. The tag is required for successful decryption, meaning that if the tag does not match after decryption, it indicates that the message has been altered and decryption fails.
